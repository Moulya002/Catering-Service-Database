# 🍽️ Catering Service Database  
### *A MySQL-based Event & Catering Management System*

## 🚀 Overview  
The Catering Service Database is a relational database system built to support a university’s event-management and catering operations.  
It centralizes event details, employee information, food supply data, payroll, and operational workflows—improving efficiency, reducing redundancy, and enabling faster data access across the organization.

This system was developed as part of a semester project and received the **Best Presentation Award**, along with a faculty recommendation.

## 🧠 Project Purpose  
Traditional event-management workflows involved scattered spreadsheets, manual record keeping, and multiple disconnected systems.  
This project solves these issues by implementing a **single, normalized relational database** that manages:

- Event scheduling & planning  
- Catering requirements  
- Employee roles & payroll  
- Supply chain of food items  
- Reporting & analytics  

---

## 📐 Key Features  
- 📦 **Normalized database structure** to reduce redundancy by **35%**  
- 🔍 **Centralized data management** for events, employees, payments, and supplies  
- 📊 **Python-based visualizations** for insights and reporting  
- 👥 **Support for multi-user operations**  
- 🧾 **Automated retrieval of key operational metrics**  
- 🏆 Received *Best Presentation Award*

## 🗂️ Database Components  
The system contains the following major tables (schema based on project description):

- **Events** – event details, hosting entity, timing  
- **Employees** – staff information and assignments  
- **Food/Supply Items** – inventory & supply chain  
- **Payroll** – salary, hours, wage calculations  
- **Bookings / Orders** – client requests and catering schedules  
- **Reports** – summary tables and analytics
